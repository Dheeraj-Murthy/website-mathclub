The Future Beneath: Speculating an Underwater Civilization

Part 1: Visuals and Documentation Process

Speculative Scenario: Life Below the Surface

This speculative scenario imagines a near-future Earth where rising sea levels, climate change, and overpopulation have driven a section of humanity to adapt to underwater living. As land becomes increasingly uninhabitable, humanity must explore the ocean as a viable domain for civilization. In this future, people either:
• undergo genetic modifications to develop fins, gills, and pressure-resistant physiology, or
• wear advanced diving suits that facilitate long-term aquatic life.

This civilization builds self-sustaining underwater cities, drawing energy from hydrothermal vents, growing food through aquaponics, and relying on algae-based oxygen regeneration systems. Society adapts to new forms of governance, aesthetics, and interaction shaped by their aquatic context.

This scenario was inspired by speculative design readings from the course (especially Auger & Loizeau’s material fictions and Dunne & Raby’s critical design principles), as well as contemporary ecological issues and rapid technological advancement in gene editing (e.g., CRISPR) and underwater robotics.

Platform Selection

I used DALL·E 3 for all image generation tasks. I chose this platform for the following reasons:
• Clarity of output: DALL·E offers high visual fidelity and can interpret detailed prompts well.
• Ease of editing: The inpainting/editing features allow iterative refinement.
• Integration with ChatGPT: Its integration allowed seamless prompt refinement and faster feedback loops.

Although MidJourney is known for artistic style, I prioritized DALL·E’s clearer rendering of complex, futuristic scenes and humanoid modifications.

Image 1: The Aquatic Metropolis

Prompt:
“Futuristic underwater city with transparent domes, bioluminescent lights, aquatic vegetation, futuristic architecture integrated into coral reefs, glowing tunnels, schools of fish swimming through city streets, blue oceanic background.”

Intent:
To depict the central hub of the underwater civilization. This image represents the urban fabric of the society – a blend of organic marine environments and futuristic architecture.

Process:
Three iterations were required. Initial attempts produced overly sci-fi visuals disconnected from the natural marine context. I refined the prompt to stress “coral integration” and “aquatic vegetation” for balance.

Image 2: Genetically Modified Citizens

Prompt:
“Underwater humans with gills and fins, swimming gracefully in ocean currents, futuristic bioengineered appearance, semi-transparent fins, glowing eyes, natural skin tones, no breathing gear, symbiosis with marine life.”

Intent:
To visualize the genetically modified population. These people have adapted to marine life through bioengineering, showcasing a post-human aesthetic.

Process:
Multiple trials were necessary to avoid overly monstrous interpretations. Prompts were adjusted to include “graceful,” “natural skin tones,” and “bioengineered beauty” to humanize the posthuman forms.

Image 3: Technologically Enhanced Divers

Prompt:
“Humans in advanced underwater suits with full helmets, biomechanical limbs, oxygen tanks, HUD display on visors, walking on seabed, background of glowing algae and hydrothermal vents, high-tech but streamlined.”

Intent:
To highlight the technological path for underwater adaptation. These citizens use gear rather than biology to thrive underwater.

Process:
Only two edits were needed. One early version had overly bulky suits, which I refined with terms like “streamlined” and “biomechanical” to emphasize sleekness.

Image 4: Cultural Ritual in the Deep

Prompt:
“Underwater ceremony with genetically modified humans and suited divers gathered in a bioluminescent coral circle, ritualistic symbols glowing, exchanging light orbs, deep spiritual tone, fusion of technology and nature.”

Intent:
To explore culture and spirituality in this speculative society. This ritual reflects their values of unity, balance with nature, and symbiosis between genetic and technological paths.

Process:
The first attempt felt too abstract. I reworded the prompt to emphasize visual clarity and “ritualistic symbols” to create a sense of meaning and tradition.

Part 2: Evaluating AI’s Output

Successes:
• DALL·E excelled at capturing bioluminescent atmospheres, making the underwater setting feel immersive.
• The blending of organic and synthetic elements was effective in conveying the dual paths of adaptation (genetic vs. technological).
• With prompt iteration, I could direct the AI to create non-threatening, human-like enhanced individuals rather than alien or monstrous ones.

Surprises:
• Early outputs interpreted “gills and fins” as horror-style mutations rather than elegant modifications.
• Some outputs used strange anatomical proportions (extra limbs or fins in odd places), which required prompt tuning.

Limitations:
• Lack of nuanced cultural detail: The AI struggled to depict subtle cultural symbols without extensive prompting.
• Human form ambiguity: When mixing technology with biology, the AI occasionally created non-viable designs (e.g., gills placed on arms).
• Repetition: Some visuals repeated motifs despite varied prompts, indicating a reliance on preset visual tropes for underwater scenes.

Improvement Suggestions:
• Allow users to provide concept sketches or image references to anchor the AI’s imagination.
• More control over anatomical realism, especially for speculative bioengineering.
• Better integration of symbolic language and cultural artifacts in speculative worldbuilding.

Part 3: Personal Reflection

This project illuminated how AI can both expand and constrain speculative design.

Enhancement of Creativity:
• The ability to rapidly prototype entire worlds visually enabled a richer exploration of ideas.
• AI served as a collaborative partner, suggesting aesthetics or combinations I might not have imagined (e.g., how coral can act as structural and spiritual elements).

Limitations on Creativity:
• AI image tools are inherently trained on existing data, which can reinforce tropes and clichés.
• Speculative design thrives on ambiguity and critical engagement—areas where AI often fails due to its literalism.

Future Use:

In my future design work, I will likely:
• Use AI-generated visuals for early-stage ideation or presentation material.
• Supplement with human sketching or CAD for precise, critical explorations.
• Remain cautious of over-relying on AI, especially where cultural nuance and ethical narratives are essential.
